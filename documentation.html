        <p>   my current portfolio goal is something sleek and simple compared to my previous one. I want to 
        <br/> showcase my projects without creating a distracting site: the focus should be on my portfolio.
        <br/> I want to show that I've got an eye for design and can create simple, elegant websites that support
        <br/> my projects. Things I plan to add are animations for the hover reveals, and to add javascript where
        <br/> it fits, just to prove I can. I saw Nick Baker's portfolio (honestly, he's probably the coolest, most talented
        <br/> person I've EVER met) and I thought some of the things he included were super cool, and I'd like to try and 
        <br/> add a slidehow of my projects that starts after a delay so that I can still keep my background image. I'd 
        <br/> also just like to add projects in general, haha. I also have ideas to completely restructure the way that the 
        <br/> projects section is set up: I think something like a giant spinner wheel, that when hovered upon, will spin and land 
        <br/> on a video of a specific project's highlights and bring up a hiddden div of information about that project would be really
        <br/> cool, but I also feel like that involves a good deal of JS and I don't know enough to pull it off (yet).
        <br/> Other notes about things like layout: I'm not a huge fan of the alternating pictures/descriptions, especially since
        <br/> that seems to be the "it" design amongst my peers. I choose it because it's a good design, though. A clasasic.
        <br/> I do like the way that the header is actually a really, really big div-I think that's rather eye-catching. I'm honestly
        <br/> very happy with this, I think it's super cute.</p>
