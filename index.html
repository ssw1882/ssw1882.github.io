                <h2>About</h2>
                <p> I am a Computer Science major from Richmond, Virginia, with a passion for Game Design and Development.
                    When I'm not designing monsters (left: a demon I was commissioned to design) or cities, 
                    you can find me playing FFXIV or buried in the rough drafts of my latest project. 
                    My biggest weakness is forcing tanks to adjust :)

                <h3>Asphodel: 2020</h3>
                <p class="galleryText"> This game jam entry was a team project done in a group of four people. 
                    I was the modeling artist for this game, and I built the maze, the props, and the looming God statues 
                    that surround the scene, as well as writing all of the voice lines. I used Maya to model all of the assets, 
                    and designed them all by hand. The hardest part was refining the God statues so that they were recognizably 
                    human, but also so the planes of the face wouldn't make odd shadows in the dim lighting. The game itself is based off of a dream I once had: the player is lost in a maze, taunted by God, 
                    and tasked with finding the right random object in order to escape. You only have five minutes to 
                    find the right key and get out!

                <h3>Asteroids: 2020</h3>
                <p class="galleryText"> EYE STRAIN WARNING! PLEASE BE MINDFUL WHEN PLAYING THIS GAME!
                    <br/>One of the class projects I did was create a Shoot-em-up 
                    arcade game based on the 80s classic Asteroids. In order to play the 
                    game, headphones are recommended. There's music! To move press the up arrow (it's 
                    like a gas pedal). Pressing the left or right arrows will turn, and hitting the space 
                    bar will shoot.

                <h3>Estherwald: 2017-2018</h3>
                <p class="galleryText"> This castle is the main setting for the introduction of my book. 
                    I made it in 3ds Max originally as a reference so when I was writing I could walk through the castle,
                    but deicded to keep it around in case I chose to make my story into a game instead. One of the hardest parts of
                    modeling this was designing it myself: I wanted it to have clear Indian/Russian influences, but I also wanted it to
                    be noticeably "fantasy". The end result is a series of standalone buildings surrounded by a wall, topped with onion
                    domes and with bridged towers interspersed.
