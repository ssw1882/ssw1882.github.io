                    My longest running project is this portfolio. It began as a class project in 2020, however I've kept
                    it updated as I need to. I plan on changing the way it looks as I learn more about front-end programming,
                    and include a lot more JS functionality.

                    This game jam entry was a team project done in a group of four people. 
                    I was the modeling artist for this game, and I built the maze, the props, and the looming God statues 
                    that surround the scene, as well as writing all of the voice lines. I used Maya to model all of the assets, 
                    and designed them all by hand. The hardest part was refining the God statues so that they were recognizably 
                    human, but also so the planes of the face wouldn't make odd shadows in the dim lighting. The game itself is based off of a dream I once had: the player is lost in a maze, taunted by God, 
                    and tasked with finding the right random object in order to escape. You only have five minutes to 
                    find the right key and get out!
